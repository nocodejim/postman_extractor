Generate the style for a containerized web application based on the Cincinnati Financial (cinfin.com) corporate branding.

**Key Elements:**
1.  **Color Palette:**
    * **Primary:** Use a professional shade of blue (similar to #1d398d, but verify if possible) for primary navigation, headers, buttons, and key accents.
    * **Secondary:** Use white (#FFFFFF) and light gray (e.g., #f0f0f0 or #f8f9fa) for backgrounds and content areas.
    * **Text:** Use dark gray or black (e.g., #333333 or #000000) for body text and a slightly lighter gray for secondary text.
    * **Accent:** Use a slightly brighter blue or potentially another complementary color sparingly for calls to action if needed, ensuring it aligns with the professional tone.
2.  **Typography:**
    * **Font Family:** Use a clean, professional sans-serif font family (e.g., Open Sans, Lato, Roboto, or Arial as a fallback) for all text.
    * **Headings:** Use a heavier weight (e.g., Semibold or Bold) for headings (h1, h2, h3).
    * **Body Text:** Use regular weight for paragraph text. Ensure good line spacing and readability.
3.  **Layout & Structure:**
    * Maintain a clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy.
    * Use a container to constrain content width for comfortable reading on wider screens.
    * Include a standard header (potentially incorporating the logo) and footer structure.
4.  **Logo:**
    * Integrate the Cincinnati Financial logo prominently, usually in the top-left of the header. Use the official logo file if available. Link: [https://www.cinfin.com/](https://www.cinfin.com/) (Logo visually present here).
5.  **Tone:** Ensure the overall style feels professional, modern, secure, and trustworthy, consistent with a financial services company. Avoid overly trendy or flashy elements.
